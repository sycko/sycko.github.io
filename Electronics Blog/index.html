<h2>Analog Lab 1</h2>

<p>For this lab we were creating a circuit where two LEDs were controlled by a switch and potentiometer. <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm4_MvlVYoM >Here</a> is the video of my circuit working, and <a href=https://www.circuitlab.com/circuit/3uzj6m/cicuit-1-for-electronics-lab/ >here</a> is the circuit diagram.</p>

<p>In addition to circuit construction we also looked into how multimeters work. These tools are essential to troubleshooting circuits. They allow us to see if each connection in a circuit is getting voltage or not, as well as the amount of voltage they are getting. In addition to voltage, many multimeters can also read current and resistance.</p>

<p>We also researched some of the past final projects that students before us have done. Here are some of my favorites: <a href=https://sarahbeilenson.wordpress.com/2014/05/09/final-report-tremolo-effect-pedal/ >this</a> tremolo effect pedal which gives a steady variation in amplitude to a guitar that was being played. There are two potentiometers on the device that changed the speed and depth of the tremolo. <a href=http://kenzoperronelectronicslab.blogspot.com/2014/05/final-project-report_8.html >This</a> piezoelectric audio trigger which allows the user to trigger bits of sound from either a square-wave oscillator or an audio input. If you tap or press the piezoelectric disk taped to the breadboard, the circuit will let out the oscillator the audio input. The final project that peaked my interest was <a href=https://matthewlauelectronicslab.wordpress.com/2014/05/08/final-lab-report/ >this</a> triangle wave synthesizer. This was a simple triangle wave synthesizer with two voices, a built in tremolo effect, and an active low-pass filter.</p>

<h2>Analog Troubleshooting List</h2>

<p>Here is where I will post all the troubleshooting I do in Analog Circuitry. Each lab that has troubleshooting will have it&rsquo;s own subtitle.</p>

<h2>Final Digital Project Report</h2>

<p>For my final project I created a MIDI contorller. Simply put this device has 16 buttons that send different MIDI notes to any electronic instrument that reads MIDI. I mainly plan on using it with my Digital Audio Workstation as a makeshift MIDI keyboard, making it easier to play melodies and record certian patterns. In addition to sending MIDI notes, it also has 4 potentiometers that can be mapped to various effects. I currently have the potentiometers set to a vinyl hiss, reverb, delay, and filter.</p>

<p>In terms of the code itself, it is fairly straightforward. I needed to include a new library to make sure everything works. This is due to the fact that I am using a new piece of equipment called an Adafruit Trellis. This is an open source backlight keypad driver that can easily be used by many different devices. In addition to the Trellis, I also have 4 potentiometers that can be programmed to control different effects. At the moment the effects I am using are a filter, a delay, some reverb, and vinyl noise. In the loop of the code I have the teensy constantly checking to see if a button has been pressed. If a button is pressed, its LED will light up and it will send a MIDI note to the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) at full velocity. If a button is not pressed the LED will not be on, and send a signal to the DAW at a velocity of 0.</p>

<p>Each of the potentiometers is set to a certain channel and analog pin. Thus allowing each effect to be have seperate controls and values.</p>

<p>Below is my code, commented for better understanding:</p>

<p><a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYuDbqb9Dz8 >Here</a> is a video of my project in action! (The hissing noise you hear during part of the video is intentional, it is one of the effects, the vinyl hiss.)</p>

<h2>Week 11</h2>

<p>I am currently waiting on certain parts for my final project to be delivered. I hope to have all the parts necessary byt the beginning of next week. I plan to review the features I want to include in my code, which we learned from previous labs. Sadly I don&rsquo;t have a video yet to show the capabilitites of my project, but I hope to have one soon. By the end of thanksgiving break I hope to have all the circuitry and assembling done with my project and focus solely on the coding itself.</p>

<h2>Week 10</h2>

<p>In regards to my final project, I am planning on making a button MIDI controller. Allowing me to use it as a makshift keyboard, or any other MIDI instrument. For this project I will need a couple of items that I don&rsquo;t already have. Including a 4x4 Adafruit Trellis Monochrome Driver, a silicone elastomer 4x4 button keypad. I will also need 4 10k potentiometers, LEDs, cutters, and jumper wires. I look forward to completing this project and using it in the future.</p>

<p>If I wanted to make a more advanced sequencer I could have it controlled by my DAW, or have it input MIDI into my DAW. In addition I could have multiple notes being played at the same time in a sequence, or I could have arpeggios happening on each note in the sequence.</p>

<p>It would be nice to know how to change the sound of each note (square, sine, sawtooth), in addition it would be cool to know how to change the sound of each note with a potometer, or being able to gradually change the harshness of the sound.</p>

<h2>Week 4</h2>

<p>In this lab we used our first Lab&rsquo;s code as an oscillator. This made a very basic monophonic squarewave synth that can hit different notes. My breadboard could only fit five buttons and therefore could only play 5 programmable notes.</p>

<p>In addition to programming different notes, we also used the &ldquo;void playFrequency(int freq)&rdquo; function in order to tidy up our code. This function allowed us to use one line of code instead of four when programming the frequency of each note being played. The &ldquo;void playFrequency&rdquo; function tells us that it is creating a fucntion called &ldquo;playFrequency&rdquo;. The &ldquo;int freq&rdquo; argument says that this function will accept an outside value in the form of integer, called frequency.</p>

<p>My final code is below:</p>

<h2>Week 1</h2>

<p><a href=http://www.instructables.com/id/Arcade-Button-MIDI-Controller/?ALLSTEPS >These</a> are instructions for a MIDI controller built using an Arduino microcontroller.  This controller can send and receive MIDI messages to your PC, and allows you to control your software program such as Traktor. The white arcade buttons you see in the picture are the inputs and each button is mapped to a different sound/signal. When a button is pressed, it sends a signal to the software which is then sent to the listener.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.instructables.com/id/LED-Dance-Room/?ALLSTEPS >This</a> is a guide to build an Audio Visualizer using an Arduino microcontroller.  This visualizer receives audio from the microphone jack of your computer, allowing it to accept it’s own sound fed back, or sound from any other audio playing device. The change in sound causes the lights to pulse and change.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.instructables.com/id/Music-Party-Facebook-Connected-Arduino-Powered-/ >This</a> is an automatically shuffling music player run by an Arduino microcontroller. A RFID reader reads the unique ID of whatever device/card was placed near it. The signal is then sent to the Arduino microcontroller, which sends a signal to the music server. Once that process is completed the preferred music of the device/card owner is added to playlist to be shuffled.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.instructables.com/id/Electronic-Music-Box-Powered-by-Arduino-sort-of/ >This</a> is the design for a music box powered by an Arduino microcontroller. The music is stored on a piece of paper and read through the device. As the paper passes through the device an infrared light reads the black and white marking on the paper and sends a signal to be played by the music box.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.instructables.com/id/This-Is-Your-Brain-On-Music/step3/Beat-detection-music-visualization-Arduino-and-Pro/ >This</a> is a design for a musical beat detector controlled by an Arduino microcontroller. The designer uses processing to register the sound, which is then transmitted to the visualizer. By using processing, the designer doesn&rsquo;t have to worry about white noise. To get different colors, the designer assigned colors to different buckets. When a beat lands in a certain bucket, that color is displayed.</p>
